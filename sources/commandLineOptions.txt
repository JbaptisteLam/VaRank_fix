-readFilter		Minimum number of reads for the variants.
			Range values: [0,-], default: 10

			Range values: [0.0,1.0], default: 0.01
 
-rsFilter		Filtering variants on the SNP information.
			Values: removeNonPathoRS (remove variants without "probable-pathogenic" or "pathogenic" annotation, see clinical significance field in dbSNP website. 
			Filtering only for variants with at least 2 validations).
			none = keep all variants, no filtering on rsID.
			Default: removeNonPathoRS

-extann			Tab separated file containing annotation to add to the final output files. Restrictions for the format are: first line is a header, first column is the gene name. 
			Typical use would be a gene file containing specific annotations such as transmission mode, disease, expression...

-metrics		Changing numerical values from frequencies to us or fr metrics (e.g. 0.2 or 0,2).
			Range values: us (default) or fr

-alamutHumanDB		Alamut Batch specific option to select the reference human genome version.

-javaPath		To explicitly set the Java path.

-dbSNP			SnpEff specific option to describe the full path to the location of the dbSNPvcf file used by SnpSift.
			Ex: “$SNPEFF/db/dbSNP.2015-01-09_00-All.vcf"

-dbNSFP			SnpEff specific option to describe the full path to the location of the dbNSFPvcf file used by SnpSift.
			Ex: "$SNPEFF/db/dbNSFP/dbNSFP2.4.txt.gz"

-phastConsDB		SnpEff specific option to describe the full path to the location phastConsdirectory used by SnpSift.
			Ex: “$SNPEFF/db/phastCons"

-uniprot		Name of the UniProt sequence file (optional, only use if PPH2 is installed).
			Ex: HUMAN.fasta.gz (default)

-refseq			Name of the RefSeq sequence file (optional, only use if PPH2 is installed).
			Ex: human.protein.faa.gz (default)

-proxyUser		Proxy User login.
-proxyPasswd		Proxy User password (optional, default is “password”).
-proxyServer		The name of the proxy.
-proxyPort		The port used by the proxy to communicate (default is “8080”).

-SamVa			To add a new column with the sample ID of the 10 first non homozygous WT variants, with their homozygote/heterozygote status. 
			Range values: yes or no (default)

-SamOut			A “Sample list”. To write output files only for selected samples.
			Ex: “sample1 sample2”. 

- AlamutProcesses	#processes (Alamut batch Standalone version only). Alamut Annotation jobs are split among multiple processes on the same computer.
			Range values: Integer (default=0, no multi-process)

- AlamutAlltrans 	Annotate variants on all transcripts with Alamut (rather than on the longest transcript).
			Range values: yes (default) or no


The following options are provided to adapt the scoring scheme to the users:

-S_Known		Known mutation as annotated by dbSNP (rsClinicalSignificance or clinVarClinSignifs="pathogenic/probable-pathogenic").

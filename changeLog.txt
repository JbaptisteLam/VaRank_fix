, 2018:VaRank version 1.4. is posted.
- Add bugfix if a line with only a tabulation is present in the configfile
- Improve the path displayed for the uniprot and refseq options
- New annotations have been added (prediction of interacting genes via FunCoup)
- Removing of HGMD columns annotations (due to the termination of HGMD annotation with the Alamut Batch version 1.10)


Aug 30, 2018:VaRank version 1.4.3 is posted.
- VaRank installation directory contains an ExtAnn directory that is now used by default to list all the additional files provided there
- Several new annotations have been added (gene intolerance to a loss of function variation, haploinsufficiency...)
- Only the first annotated gene of each variant will be annotated with external annotations
- For a variant annotated on several transcripts of a same gene, keep (i) the transcript annotation with the best score or (ii) with an equal score the longest transcript annotation

- Add bugfix concerning Alamut annotation

Jun 1, 2018: VaRank version 1.4.1 is posted.
- Add bugfix concerning NNS annotation with Alamut (previous Alamut annotations need to be removed before to run a VaRank analysis again)

Apr 17, 2018: VaRank version 1.4 is posted.

Fixed Issues/changes:
- In order to add more flexibility to the output files, the user can now select the annotation columns and their order using the configfile
- Warning: several output column names have changed. Please check in the README file
- Several new annotations have been added (gnomAD, Align GVGD, gene inheritance mode...)
- Due to a high false positive calls observed for indels in the EVS dataset, the EVS annotations have been removed from the output and automatic filtering
- Support Alamut-batch version 1.6 to 1.9 (January 2018)
- Support SnpEff version 4.2 to 4.3 (build 2017-11-24) (Requires Java 1.8)
- Add bugfix: in some cases, a variation could be annotated using the non optimal isoform or gene (i.e. a variation localized either downstream of gene1 or in an intron of gene2 is now annotated preferentially to the intron of gene2)
- Variation with a depth of coverage equal to 0 are now annotated and reported in the output files
- Add bugfix: a variation associated with 2 genes and annotated with a pathogenic effect from ClinVar can not lead to the report of the non optimal gene anymore


Aug 08, 2016: VaRank version 1.3.5 is posted.

Fixed Issues/changes:
- Support version 1.5.2 (July 2016) of Alamut-batch including novel local splice effect scores and branch point analysis
- Variants causing a premature stop codon in the coding sequence are now reported as ‘stop gain’ in the codingEffect output field instead of ‘nonsense’ which is now deprecated
- Change in ExAC annotations: homozygous frequencies are now replaced by the homozygous count
- Add of the --outputDataVersions when running Alamut-batch (reporting of databases names and corresponding versions)
- Add of the "-vcfFields" option. Allows to selectively report fields from the INFO column to the output files.
- Add of the "-SamOut" option. Write output files only for selected samples (not for all samples of all VCF input files)
- Enhance Alamut Batch error messages
- Add bugfix concerning external annotations (when containing "{}" characters)
- Add bugfix concerning detection of the number of read for the variant from the vcf file (with NR, AD, AC, AO and DV fields)

- Add bugfix for the specific treatment of allele count to compensate bad behavior from Torrent Suite VCF files


Dec 15, 2015: VaRank version 1.3.1 is posted.
- Add of the "AlamutProcesses" option (available only with the "standalone" Alamut version)
- Add of the "AlamutAlltrans" option (available only with the Alamut Batch annotation)
- Add bugfix concerning scoring of the "stop loss" and "start loss" variants.


Nov 12, 2015: VaRank version 1.3 is posted. 
- Compatibility with the version 4.2 of the VCF format. Reporting in the VaRank outputs of the ‘*’ alleles (upstream deletion) 
- Scoring scheme improvement: new category for splice site creation and score adjustment for some categories (available only with Alamut Batch annotation) 
- Creation of a new output file (VaRankIDlinkedToVCF.txt), giving for each VaRankID a correspondence between the genome position and the VCF positions (can be different for indels)
- Add of the "SpSiAnnotation" column
- Add of the "-SamVa" option. A new column (SamVa) available to display samples and zigosity status different from the reference sequence within the barcode (up to 10 different samples) 
- Add bugfix concerning scoring of the dbSNP pathogenic variants 
- Add bugfix for some rare situation in the VCF in which the multiple alternate variants would be skipped and not counted in the barcode 
- New method to filter out benign annotated variants in dbSNP 
- Compatible with Alamut Batch 1.4.2 (Jul. 2015)
